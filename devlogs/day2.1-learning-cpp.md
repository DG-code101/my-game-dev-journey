# 🗓️ Dev Log – Day 2.1: Struggling Through the Lasagna Exercise

## 📅 Date
2025-10-15

## 🧠 What I Worked On
- Focused on the “Lasagna” exercise under the Basics section on [Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/cpp)
- Tried solving it independently, but ran into logic issues
- Reviewed community solutions to understand better approaches
- Refactored my code and eventually passed all test cases

## 💡 What I Learned
- How to define and call functions in C++
- How to structure code to meet specific test cases
- That reading community solutions can unlock new ways of thinking

## 🧪 Challenges I Faced
- Misunderstood the problem requirements at first
- My initial solution didn’t pass all the tests
- Had to lean on community examples to break through

## 🎯 Next Steps
- Continue with the next few exercises on Exercism
- Start building a small utility library for my game project
- Document any reusable patterns I discover

## 🗣️ Notes or Reflections
Today was a reminder that struggling is part of learning. Seeing how others approached the problem helped me break through. I’m proud I didn’t give up—and I’m starting to feel more confident writing C++.
