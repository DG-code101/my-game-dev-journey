## 📅 Date
2025-10-19

## 🧠 What I Worked On
- Edited and posted two TikTok videos showing my progress on Exercism
  - Video 1: Starting the C++ track
  - Video 2: Lasagna exercise and community help
- Updated my GitHub dev logs to reference the TikTok posts
- Finalized my project tagline:  
  > “One dev. One vision. One game inspired by faith.”

## 💡 What I Learned
- How to use CapCut to trim, caption, and animate dev content
- How to align my GitHub logs with my TikTok posts for consistency
- That documenting visually adds a whole new layer to my dev story

## 🧪 Challenges I Faced
- Had to split my screen recordings into two separate TikTok posts
- Took time to find the right pacing and captions for each video
- Making sure the GitHub links and TikTok references matched up

## 🎯 Next Steps
- Continue with the next Exercism exercises
- Start planning the first gameplay mechanic for *Testament*
- Draft a roadmap section for my GitHub README
