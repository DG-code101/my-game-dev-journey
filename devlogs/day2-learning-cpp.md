## 🧠 What I Worked On
- Signed up for the C++ track on [Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/cpp)
- Completed the “Hello World” and basic syntax exercises
- Explored how Exercism uses test-driven learning with mentor feedback

## 💡 What I Learned
- How to write and test a basic C++ function
- The structure of a simple C++ program
- That Exercism provides real-world coding practice with community support

## 🧪 Challenges I Faced
- Took a bit of time to understand how to run Exercism CLI locally
- Had to configure my environment to compile and test C++ files properly

## 🎯 Next Steps
- Continue with the next few exercises on Exercism
- Start building small utility functions I might use in my game
- Document my learning in code comments and dev logs
